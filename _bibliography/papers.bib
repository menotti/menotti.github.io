abstract = {Context: Testing adaptive systems (ASs) is particularly challenging due to certain characteristics such as the high number of possible configurations, runtime adaptations and the interactions between the system and its surrounding environment. Therefore, the combination of different testing approaches in order to compose a strategy is expected to improve the quality of the designed test suites. Objective: To devise and experiment with a testing strategy for ASs that relies on particular characteristics of these systems. Method: We ranked testing approaches for ASs and devised a strategy that is composed of the three top-ranked ones. The rankings address the challenges that can be mitigated by the approaches, activities from a typical testing process, and characteristics observed in some AS implementations. The strategy was applied to two adaptive systems for mobile devices. Results: The approach was applied to both systems. We observed partial gains in terms of fault detection and structural coverage when results are analysed separately for each system, even though no improvements were obtained with the application of the third approach. Conclusion: The strategy, despite being incipient, is promising and motivates a deeper analysis of results and new experiment rounds. Furthermore, it can evolve as long as the rankings are updated with new approaches.},

abstract = {Context: Exercising the implementation of an adaptive system (AS) effectively, in order to detect faults, is not a trivial task. This is due to characteristics of this type of systems, such as the high number of configurations and runtime adaptations. In this context, the characterisation of challenges for testing ASs may support the definition of suitable testing strategies. However, such characterisation is currently spread over several studies in the literature. Objective: analysing testing-related challenges for ASs which are described in the literature, and establishing a generic classification. Method: we extended a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of studies that address challenges for AS testing. By analysing the combined results (original and extended), we mapped descriptions found in individual studies, based on their similarities, in order to create a list of generic challenges. Results: a list of 12 generic challenges based on 34 specific ones described by several authors. Additionally, we analysed the relationship between the challenges and inherent properties of ASs. Conclusion: different terminology, varied levels of details and particular contexts (e.g. specific AS implementations) are recurring problems related to the characterisation of challenges for testing ASs. Generalisations such as the one proposed in this work may help researchers and practitioners do devise customised testing strategies that focus in recurring, inherent properties of ASs.},

abstract="A common use for Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) is the implementation of hardware accelerators. A way of doing so is to specify the internal logic of such accelerators by using Hardware Description Languages (HDLs). However, HDLs rely on the expertise of developers and their knowledge about hardware development with FPGAs. Regarding this, efforts have been focused on developing High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools in an attempt to increase the overall abstraction level required for using FPGAs. However, the solutions presented by such tools are commonly considered inefficient in comparison to the ones achieved by a specialized hardware designer. An alternative solution to program FPGAs is the use of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), as they can provide higher abstraction levels than HDLs still allowing the developers to deal with specific issues leading to more efficient designs and not always covered by HLS tools. In this chapter we present our recent work on a DSL named LALP (Language for Aggressive Loop Pipelining), which has been designed focusing on the development of FPGA-based, aggressively pipelined, hardware accelerators. We present the recent LALP extensions and the challenges we are facing regarding to the compilation of LALP to FPGAs.",

journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
abstract = {This paper presents LALPC, a prototype high-level synthesis tool, specialized in hardware generation for loop-intensive code segments. As demonstrated in a previous work, the underlying hardware components target by LALPC are highly specialized for loop pipeline execution, resulting in efficient implementations, both in terms of performance and resources usage (silicon area). LALPC extends the functionality of a previous tool by using a subset of the C language as input code to describe computations, improving the usability and potential acceptance of the technique among developers. LALPC also enhances parallelism exploitation by applying loop unrolling, and providing support for automatic generation and scheduling of parallel memory accesses. The combination of using the C language to automate the process of hardware design, with an efficient underlying scheme to support loop pipelining, constitutes the main goal and contribution of the work described in this paper. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of those techniques to enhance performance, and also exemplifies how some of the LALPC compiler features may support performance-resources trade-off analysis tasks.}
